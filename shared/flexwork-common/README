# flexwork-common

Helper JS functions used for both front and back end

The front end and back end's package.json are already updated

"npm i" in /frontend and /backend to get the latest version of this in the respective projects
or just "npm i flexwork-common" to skip re-checking every other module


#### Usage in back end:

- const fw = require("flexwork-common");
- fw.isAvailabilityHealthy

### Usage in front end:

- import * as fw from "flexwork-common";
- fw.isAvailabilityHealthy

## Current contents:

#### canBook(availability, booking)
  To be used for validation
  returns true iff the booking can be made in the availability
  i.e. all the days in the range [booking.startDate, booking.endDate]
    are in openDates(availability)

#### isAvailabilityHealthy(availability)
  returns true iff the availability
 - has both a start date and end date
 - start date <= end date
 - has a bookings array
 - the bookings each have a start and end date
 - the bookings' start date is <= end date
 - the bookings are all within bounds
 - the bookings are chronologically sorted
 - the bookings do not overlap

#### isDate(obj)
  returns true iff the obj is a JavaScript Date

#### openDates(availability)
  returns a list of JavaScript Date objects, one for each day
  that a booking can be made on an availability.
  I.e. the set of all days of the availability - the set of days taken by its
  current bookings

#### openDatesInRange(availability, startDate, endDate)
  like openDates, but can be restricted to a more limited date range
